First of all, let's remind the laptop's specs.

## Specs

- Intel HD 5500

- 8Gb DDR3 @ 1600MHz
- 14"- 1920*1080
- 500Gb HDD - SATA

If your laptop isn't the exact same one you should look for a guide specifically featuring yours.

Installing macOS on non-Apple hardware is a violation of their EULA.
This is intended as an experiment and will most likely not work as a daily driver.
Keep in mind that all of this is experimental and Apple could end it at any version.

Neither me nor the contributors are responsible if anything happens to your device.
You're the sole responsible for what you do and *SHOULD* do your research before blindly following any guide.

Now that I'm done saving my ass and judging you, let's get started.
