# Vanilla MacOS Mojave on an HP Elitebook 840 G2

Welcome on another Hackintosh guide !

This is a simple yet complete step by step guide on how to install MacOS Mojave on an HP Elitebook 840 G2.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# DISCLAIMER

**Installing macOS on non-Apple hardware is a violation of their EULA.<br>
This is intended as an experiment and will most likely not suit your needs as a daily driver.**

Keep in mind that all of this is **experimental** and Apple could _end it_ at **any version.**<br>
_(Always make a backup before updating, you never know.)_

**Neither me nor the contributors are responsible if anything happens to you, your devices, Flash Drives, Laptop's components or anything else.**<br>
**You're the sole responsible for what you do** and **SHOULD** do your research before _blindly_ following any guide.

## Quick facts & answers

_Why another f*ing guide ?_

- I don't like the way [all those guides](https://www.tonymacx86.com/forums/mojave-laptop-guides.197/) are written.<br>
  Sorry Nguyenmac, Rehabman & Spotflight, I read them a hundred times but it's really hard to understand how we got here.<br>
  I think it's the forum that makes it _'less readable'_, the general look, font, structure... I don't know.<br>
  This guide will focus on doing the job instead of explaining every step, so there is that.

_Why this laptop ?_

- I had to buy it when I studied at Epitech Strasbourg, in France.<br>
  This specific laptop was mandatory & totally not worth the money.<br>
  If I had another device, I'd gladly hackintosh it too, it's a fun and enriching experiment !

_Do I risk anything ?_

- You could fry your Motherboard or CPU, corrupt your HDD / SSD, lose precious data if there are any, get sued by Apple, find yourself teleported into AREA 51 ..<br>
  I mean, anything is possible right ?

_Can I get the Wifi / Bluetooth card to work ?_

- The short answer is no.<br>
  The longer answer would be :<br>
  "Because Apple never used Intel Wifi cards, there's no support for them.<br>
  You could potentially swap your current card for one used by Apple.<br>
  A refurbished Broadcom BCM94352Z on Ali-XPress should do the trick !"

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Specs

- Intel **i7-5600U**
- Intel **HD 5500**
- Radeon R7 M260X _(Disabled)_
- 8Gb DDR3 @ 1600MHz
- 14"- 1920*1080
- 500Gb HDD - SATA

If your laptop isn't the exact same one you should look for a guide _specifically featuring **yours.**_<br>
Hackintosh guides are "kinda" vanilla but this one will really focus on the Broadwell i7 equipped HP Elitebook 840 G2.

## Ã˜ - PREPARATION

### HARDWARE

- **A legit Apple device running MacOS**. _Can be a Mac Mini, Macbook (Pro), iMac, iWhatever._<br>
  _Don't use a VM for this, you'll waste your time, but a Hackintosh would work lmao_
- **An Ethernet Cable**<br>
  _You won't have Wi-Fi_
- **USB Flash Drive** - at leat 8Gb<br>
  _USB 2.0 seems more stable but 3.0 works too_
- **HDD / SSD** SATA or mSATA<br>
  **_For NVMe drives you'll need a different guide._**
