# I - BIOS

Before installing MacOS we have to set our BIOS properly.<br>
It needs to look "fresh outta factory" so let's clean that up !

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Ã˜ - Enter BIOS Menu

- Your laptop needs to have AC and Ethernet connected.
- Boot it up.
- Press `F10` on boot.<br>
  If you're late, press `CTRL + ALT + DEL` and retry.

## I - Update your BIOS

- **Main Tab**
- Update system BIOS
  - Check HP.com for BIOS Updates
- Let it install & reboot (approx 3mn)

## II - Restore default settings

- [Enter BIOS menu](#0---enter-bios-menu)
- **Main Tab**
- Restore Defaults
  - Yes
- Reboot

## III - Set the BIOS for MacOS

Since whe restored the default settings, we will only need to change a handful of settings.<br>
If what I check is already checked or what I uncheck is already unchecked : let it be.<br>
All we need is to have the same options enabled and disabled, don't touch anything unless you know what you're doing.<br>
You'll have plenty of time to tweak and play with them **once it works**.<br>

Here we go then :
