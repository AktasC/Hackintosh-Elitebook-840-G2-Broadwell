# Credits

First of all, sorry for not providing your repos in the download sections.<br>
I knew the drive was automagically kept up-to-date so I decided to go with a centralized source.

I've never been good at thanking people but here we go :

- [Acidanthera](https://github.com/acidanthera/) - **Illuminati**  
  Can't say much more, you made a lot of sh\*t possible... Thanks for your work guys !

- [NguyenMac](https://www.tonymacx86.com/members/nguyenmac.598852/) - **Guide Senpai**  
  For creating and maintaining the guide I used to follow for so long, contributed to turn me into a _mad_ SysAdmin, at least more than I used to be.

- [Rehabman](https://github.com/rehabman) - **Laptop Guru**  
  Guides, configs, kexts, SSDTS, ~drugs,~ **you name it**. This guy has 'em all !

- [Spotflight](https://www.tonymacx86.com/members/spotflight.1654314/) - **Elitebook Chief**  
  For his simplified / modernized guide which helped me avoid some obsolete tricks I used to use.

- **Every single other contributor, developer, pioneer in the hackintosh scene** who helped achieve all of this.

_Coffee & poverty made me do it_.
