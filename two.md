## Ã˜ - Preparation

- Launch a terminal
- `diskutil list`
- You need your **USB DRIVE'S** `IDENTIFIER` must look like `disk1`
  - Double check it's the good one and not your HDD.
- `diskutil partitionDisk /dev/IDENTITIFER 2 MBR FAT32 "CLOVER" 200Mi HFS+J "INSTALL" R`
  - Double check you've replaced `IDENTIFIER` with the proper `diskX` before pressing ENTER

You should have a brand new USB stick named CLOVER

  - `RealtekRTL8111.kext`
  - `SATA-unsupported.kext`

- Delete this part of the file :

```XML
    <key>DVMT-prealloc</key>
    <string>32MB BIOS, 19MB framebuffer, 9MB cursor bytes (credit RehabMan)</string>
    <key>framebuffer-patch-enable</key>
    <integer>1</integer>
    <key>framebuffer-stolenmem</key>
    <data>AAAwAQ==</data>
    <key>framebuffer-fbmem</key>
    <data>AACQAA==</data>
```

  - Save & Close
- Copy your `config.plist` to `/Volumes/CLOVER/EFI/CLOVER/` (replace the old one)
